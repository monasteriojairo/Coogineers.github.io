## Feb 9th - Feb 22nd (Completed and/or In Progress Tasks)
During this period, we completed the inspection of the final gearbox upon its arrival. While the custom parts are currently being machined and are expected to be finished by the end of February, we began assembling the electronic components. The team discovered that the motors we ordered do not include adapter cables compatible with our ClearCore motor controllers. We are in the process of placing a second purchase order for missing components such 8pin (4+4) cables, 12V power supply, higher rating fuses and electrical housing box. As our expenses start to approach the budget, we are extra cautious with our spending to keep the cost low.

## Feb 23rd - Mar 15th (Near-Term Plan and Milestone)
We will perform a final inspection of the machined parts to ensure all tolerances meet specifications before proceeding with assembly and installation. This will be followed by a bench mounting and alignment verification on the mock up station. The team will continue to collaborate on the control programming shared on GITHUB along doing wirings and properly intergrating electrical component inside the enclosure, ensuring proper cable management for organization and protection. Finally, we will verify safety features are working and test the combined motion sequences in slow speed. 

## Next two weeks (Obstacles + Solutions + Backup plans)
